assertion: random auditing less effective than total or segmented total.

assertion: increasing audit freq beyond some point gives little improvement across a wide range of error rates.

assertion: auditing more frequently than annually does not confer much additional protective benefit.

assertion: random auditing that does not cover the collection, i.e., with replacement, is less effective than strategy that touches every document.

assertion: auditing robust across range of error rates.

assertion: auditing robust across short term variations in storage quality. (glitches)

question: auding robustness in the face of shocks that kill multiple servers.

assertion: without auditing, many copies needed to prevent perm losses.

picture: straight Poisson: copies=1 losses y over sector half-lives x.

picture: document size scales with sector half-life. life 10 size 5 = life 100 size 50 = life 1000 size 500; or did i get that backwards? do all these with copies=1 and no auditing.

picture: annual audit with 5 copies reduces losses to negligible, maybe zero, over very large range of sector lifetimes.  compare with 2, 3, 4 copies, i think.

picture: quarterly or faster auditing not noticeably better than annual.

picture: glitches equivalent to slightly shorter sector lifetime.
even minor shocks equivalent to very large glitches.

table: disk drive error rates from backblaze, google, et al., just samples of numbers all over the place.

table: Poisson theoretical vs simulated numbers of errors for range of sector lifetime, sector size, document size, simulation length.

model: billing failure or government takedown: shock with 100% impact (instantly fatal); short frequency; span 1, 2, 3.

model: financial recession: shocks with various frequencies; various impacts < 100%; various spans.

model: low resource external adversary: dunno.

model: HVAC failures, flaky power: glitches with frequency high; impact low to medium; lifetimes medium.  

model: environmental catastrophe: shocks; frequency low; impact high or fatal; span low.

model: local software failure: shocks; freq med; impact med; duration long.

model: administrator error: 

model: hardware batch poor quality:
