<h1 id="pretty-pictures-we-need-for-the-paper-publication-quality">Pretty pictures we need for the paper, <em>publication quality</em></h1>
<p>RBLandau 20180813</p>
<hr />
<p>Notes on pictures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspect ratio 16:10, raw size 1600x1000 or greater for publication, 800x500 for easier viewing while editing. [Do journals have standards for sizes and aspects? <em>Science</em> does, but I've never looked at others.]</li>
<li>All log-log.</li>
<li>Almost all need decade lines for loss rates: 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, I think. Horizontal dotted lines with small labels. Would be good if the lines were easily distinguished, e.g., by weight, but not clear that's possible. What would Tufte say?</li>
<li>X half-life scales 2-1000 or 2-100.</li>
<li>Legends upper right (if I can force legends at all; may have to be manual annotations, yuck).</li>
<li>Attempt consistent color labeling for number of copies, but not sure this is reasonable in R.</li>
<li>Describe data plots: #copies, losses, error injection, log scales x and y, percent losses, trimmed means (25%=midmean, maybe only 10%) of sample size=21, colors=black or blue usually best case recommendation.</li>
<li>Describe why low half-lives and why 3,4 copies: otherwise numbers too small to make clear pictures, best to look at where the differences are exaggerated but parallel.<br />
</li>
<li>Note that one would never actually use disks with such low half-lives, but they are needed to show the phenomena.<br />
</li>
<li>I will have to regerate the data for most of these, rats.<br />
</li>
<li>Comments inside the graph area will be done with annotation(), also rats.</li>
</ul>
