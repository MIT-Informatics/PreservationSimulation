<h2 id="core-assumptions">Core Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Documents are stored on storage servers, on (currently) rotating disk memories.<br />
</li>
<li>Documents may be lost by becoming unreadable from storage. Such individual document failures are independent of one another.<br />
</li>
<li>A storage server may fail and cause all the data stored on that server to be lost. Such failures are random and occur at some rate. The rate may vary due to exogenous circumstances. Major storage failures are very rare events compared with individual document failures.<br />
</li>
<li>Storage servers are independent of each other. Each server has a characteristic rate of failures of stored data. Different storage servers may have different associated failure rates.<br />
</li>
<li>It is possible that the failure rate within a server is not constant over time. However, over suitably short intervals, a changing rate can be approximated by some mean value in the interval.<br />
</li>
<li>Failures of disk data occur in small regions, e.g., blocks of data or small groups of blocks of data. These data failures within a storage service occur randomly and independently among the disk resources of the storage server.<br />
</li>
<li>Documents may occupy more or less storage depending on their size. Since failures of blocks of storage are random and independent, a failure is more likely to be located within a large document than within a small one.</li>

<h2 id="basic-model-framework">Basic Model Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li>The model employs one client library with one collection that contains a large number of documents. Results for multiple clients, for clients with multiple collections, or for varying number of documents can be extrapolated from this simple case.<br />
</li>
<li>The client assigns some number of external servers to store a copy of the collection of documents. Each server is supposed to maintain, and be able to retrieve on demand, an authentic copy of any of the documents in the collection.<br />
</li>
<li>Documents may fail on the servers. When a document fails on a server, the failure is silent. The client is not immediately informed of the failure. Indeed, the server might not be able to sense that the failure has occurred until it tries to retrieve the document on a request from the client.<br />
</li>
<li>The model does not consider the costs of storage or bandwidth. These factors vary widely and change rapidly. Any conclusions based on specific numbers would become obsolete very quickly. However, some possibilities for minimizing or smoothing bandwidth consumption are considered.<br />
</li>
<li>From time to time, the client may test the copies of documents on servers to ensure that they can still be read and are still valid copies. The model supports this process of auditing the collection. Audits can be scheduled and performed using a variety of schedules and strategies.<br />
</li>
<li>If in the process of auditing the collection, a document is found to have failed on a server, the client tests all other copies of the document on all other servers. If an intact copy remains on any other server, the client will refresh the failed copy and continue. If no other intact copy remains, the document is considered to be permanently lost.<br />
</li>
<li>At the end of the simulation time period, the model assesses all copies of documents on all servers to determine how many documents have been permanently lost.<br />
</li>
<li>This entire simulation cycle is repeated a number of times using different values to seed the (pseudo-)random number generator that drives the simulation. The numbers from all runs are collected and presented in tabular form and in graphical summaries in the supplemental material.</li>

<li>Auditing is systematic

<li>Random auditing, with replacement, is less effective.<br />
</li>
<li>Systematic auditing, periodically and without replacement, is most effective.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Auditing may be performed in segments, e.g., an annual audit can be broken into halves, one half the collection every half year, either systematically selected or randomly selected without replacement; or one quarter of the collection every quarter, and so forth.<br />
</li>
<li>Auditing and egress charges -- piecemeal is ok</li>
<li>Auditing charges would be reduced by cryptographic affordances on cloud-server side ...</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Robustness 1, Robust to audit frequency a. The impact of the rate of auditing is surprisingly less influential than the auditing strategy. Auditing more frequently than annually has little impact on losses, across a wide spectrum of error rates. b. Systematic auditing in a small number of segments, e.g., auditing one quarter of the collection every calendar quarter, is slightly more effective than one large, annual audit, and eases bandwidth requirements.

<p>A number of sources are not modeled, but are assumed to be addressed through storage practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bathtub curve, accelerate start and end-of-life failures. The model is conditioned on good systems administration practice is in place, including equipment burn-in and scheduled replacement within the expected service life. Thus the error rate observed during the service life of the equipment should not be subject to these failure.</li>
<li>Raid configuration characteristics, internal raid errors. Standard storage practice may include low-level physical redundancy. Thus the reliability of a logical block will be better than that of an underlying physical storage. When using the model, one should calibrate error rates based on the implied or observed failure rates of logical blocks -- each of which may be represented by redundant physical storage.</li>
<li>Media format obsolence -- we assume good practice -- migration to new media bewfore end of life.</li>
<li>Unmanaged File Format obsolescence.
<ul>
<li>Management can mitigate file format obsolescence where documents are stored in multiple formats (or multiple indepent readers) and tested for format characteristics at audit. Failures occur at the level an entire document, but the threat of loss could be modeled as with a block error rate implying a certain document failure rate for fixed size documents, where the number of servers represents the number of independent formats stored.</li>
<li>Unmanaged format obsolescence cannot be addressed through redundancy, etc. -- will not show on audits</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What are are not modeling - Sophisticated adversaries that attack the auditing mechanism - Cascading failure/contagion - Environmental glitch that directly affect background rate of server glitch - Server characteristics are in a steady -state equlibrium -- characteristic of servers remain the same over time.</p>
