#PreservationSimulation

Libraries, academic and corporate, have large collections of documents that they with to preserve for long periods.  The standard strategy for preserving documents is to make multiple copies and distribute the copies geographically.  
A question that needs to be answered is how many copies to keep.  For a variety of conditions -- document sizes and types, storage error rates, auditing strategies, etc. -- we need to know how many copies we should keep, how many copies we can afford to keep.  

This project uses computer simulations to estimate document failure rates over a wide variety of conditions.
