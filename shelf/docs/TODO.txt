TODO


extractvalues.py
DONE - add optional arg for --separator=','
DONE - default should still be space
- if i use comma, then datacleanup can use DictReader.  not a big deal.
- actually, Dialect.delimiter can be set to whatever i want.
- maybe just use reader with delimiter=' ' and dict(zip()) 
   the header list and data list together.  
DONE - recode entirely to force filter first thing, to reduce the size
    of the internal lists required, and speed things up.  

   
100% glitch impact
DONE - shelf destroy all documents on shelf.
DONE - server inform client of shelf failure.
DONE - server refuse document additions to that shelf, 
  or maybe shelf just always answers that it's full.
WRONG - server probably should refuse to make a new shelf.  
DONE - client go shopping for another server to replace dead one.
WRONG - if duration is short, then server may recover before the
  client even notices; however, all documents still have been lost,
  so the next audit will find many dead docs.  
  
brokercommands
DONE - slow down after extractvalues, too.


broker.py
DONE - increase the stuck timer a lot.
- protect against grep failure, linux vs windows.


newinstructions
- write filter for instructions as they are being generated flat
  hierarchical: a field named action for permit/deny
- write rules for the filter
  rules in a list of json dictionaries
  first rule is permit *, then list of denies maybe slightly countermanded
- integrate into last stage of flat instruction generation

newnewinstructions
- custom flat db or maybe tiny or buzhug
- facade or adapter: same interface as current mongolib
- new load, list, and clear utilities that use flatlib
- eventually, web app to generate smallish sets of instructions

packaging
DONE - do Docker basic tutorials
DONE - construct vm platforms for docker learning on both systems
- transcribe crummy bash script to dockerfile

nonmonotonicity testing
- do runs in the sensitive areas, limited to 3-4 lifetimes and few copies
- runs with 100 or more seeds?
- many runs with 20ish seeds to assess variability?
- jacknife the existing numbers?

runs for September presentation
- what graphics needed?
- what numbers to compute?
