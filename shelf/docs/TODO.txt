TODO

extractvalues.py
DONE - add optional arg for --separator=','
DONE - default should still be space
- if i use comma, then datacleanup can use DictReader.
- actually, Dialect.delimiter can be set to whatever i want.
- maybe just use reader with delimiter=' ' and dict(zip()) 
   the header list and data list together.  
DONE - recode entirely to force filter first thing, to reduce the size
    of the internal lists required, and speed things up.  
   
100% glitch impact
DONE - shelf destroy all documents on shelf.
DONE - server inform client of shelf failure.
DONE - server refuse document additions to that shelf, 
  or maybe shelf just always answers that it's full.
WRONG - server probably should refuse to make a new shelf.  
DONE - client go shopping for another server to replace dead one.
WRONG - if duration is short, then server may recover before the
  client even notices; however, all documents still have been lost,
  so the next audit will find many dead docs.  
  
brokercommands
DONE - slow down after extractvalues, too.
