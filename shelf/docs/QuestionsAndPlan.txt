How on earth do we organize the SHELF results?  
Too many dimensions, way too many cases.  

Dimensions of variation that are important for filing:
- audit frequency: quarter, year, 2year.
- audit type: total qtr, yr, 2yr; systematic 1yr in 4, 10 segs.
- audit segments: 1, 4, only if annual.
- shock frequency: 2, 3, 5, 10yr.
- shock impact: 33, 50, 67.
- shock span: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- shock maxlife: 1, 2yr.
- server default life:0, 10yr.


Dimensions of variation that are vanilla, unimportant for filing, but 
 are always included and reported:
- ncopies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.
- sector lifetime: 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000.


Plan:

1. Does fast auditing really matter?  Audit total qtr, 1, 2 yr.  All others
null.  

2. Does systematic auditing help, hurt, neutral?  Audit systematic 1, 2 yr.  
Audit segments 2, 4, maybe 10.  

3. How bad is shock?  Shock freq 3, 5, 10 yr.  Span 1, 3, 5.  Impact 50, 67.  
Length 1, 2 yr.  Audit total 1 yr, qtr.  

. . . 

9. Reverify that glitches are indistinguishable from decreased sector life.  
glitch freq qtr, 1, 2 yr.  impact 50.  length 1 month.
