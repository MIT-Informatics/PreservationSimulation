in db:
  incl 11 seeds or 21, separate databases for these
  select by criteria
  dictionary object, one seed per

broker:
  foreach selected run
  format instruction for actor
    generator for instruction list
    yield next instruction
  if no runner, spawn one
  if no cleaner, spawn one

  get results returned by caller (runner) 
  (how? do results correspond to last output? no.)
  (do NOT wait for results before next yield)
  post results to Results table
  post _id in Done table


runner (one copy):
  (no mongodb knowledge from here out)
  is there a core available?
    pull next instruction from list
    create run instruction
    create extract instruction
    spawn a listactor for command in list, with &
    return results to broker


listactor (NCORES copies):
  gets list of command strings
  spawns an actor for each string, in succession
  maybe just dumb command sequencer, gets list of shell syntax
  one line, one run
  all options fleshed out literally, no substitutions

run
  python main.py . . . .
  single line instruction
  no & for asynchrony
  output redirected to log file

get one liner
  sh getalllines-new.sh - not needed
  python extractvalues.py logfile 
  single line output redirected to file


Cleaner (one copy, free running):
  look for single-line files
  foreach file
    parse file into dictionary
    store in db Results table
    append to master results file
