#PreservationSimulation

Libraries, academic and corporate, have large collections of documents that they with to preserve for long periods.  A standard strategy for preserving documents is to make multiple copies, if possible, and distribute the copies geographically.  Increasingly, library collections come in digital form rather than dead-tree form, which makes them easier to copy and distribute.  

A first question that needs to be answered is how many copies to keep.  For a variety of conditions -- document sizes and types, storage error rates, auditing strategies, etc. -- we need to know how many copies we should keep, how many copies we can afford to keep economically.  We can also deal with various strategies for "auditing" a collection, that is, checking on its status adn repairing damage if necessary.  

The purpose of this project is to provide baseline data for librarians and researchers about long-term survival rates of document collections.  We have developed computer simulations to estimate document failure rates over a wide variety of conditions.  

The simuations are necessarily schematic in that they don't attempt to model the details of real-life situations.  Instead, the simulations are targeted at specific points in a huge sample space, providing bases from which users can extrapolate to approximate their actual environments.
