All the random numbers in these lists are 
True Random Numbers from random.org;
they are produced by atmospheric noise 
and not by pseudo-random calculations.
Thank you, random.org.

These numbers are intended to be used as seeds
for the Python pseudorandom number generator, 
which is based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm.
